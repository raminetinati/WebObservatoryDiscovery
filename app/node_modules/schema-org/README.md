# node-schema-org

A node.js library that retrieves, parses and provides all schemas from schema.org

## Installation

### Installing npm (node package manager)
```
  curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
```

### Installing node-schema-org
```
  [sudo] npm install schema-org
```

## Motivation
Although there is some debate from the W3C et al right now, when I came across [schema.org][0] I thought: "wow, what a gold mine of potential data formats to use in my applications." Then I looked at the site and thought: **"Y U NO GIVE ME JSON FORMAT!?!?!"** So I wrote this. It uses some other awesome node.js libraries:

* [jsdom](http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom): CommonJS implementation of the DOM intended to be platform independent and as minimal/light as possible while completely adhering to the w3c DOM specifications.
* [neuron](http://github.com/indexzero/neuron): The simplest possible event driven job manager, FIFO queue, and "task based cache" in node.js
* [optimist](http://github.com/substack/node-optimist): Light-weight option parsing for node.js
* [request](http://github.com/mikeal/request): Simplified HTTP request client.
* [winston](http://github.com/indexzero/winston): A multi-transport async logging library for node.js

## Usage
Right now, `node-schema-org` is implemented as a bin script which can be run after you install this module: 

``` bash
  $ read-schema-org
```

Here is a sample of the output (all of the pre-parsed schemas are available [here](http://github.com/indexzero/node-schema-org/tree/master/schemas)):
